        "\n",
        "If you arrived at this point you already know how to use Avalanche strategies and are ready to use it. However, before making your own strategies you need to understand a little bit the internal implementation of the training and evaluation loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "In _Avalanche_ you can customize a strategy in 2 ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Plugins**: Most strategies can be implemented as additional code that runs on top of the basic training and evaluation loops (e.g. the `Naive` strategy). Therefore, the easiest way to define a custom strategy such as a regularization or replay strategy, is to define it as a custom plugin. The advantage of plugins is that they can be combined, as long as they are compatible, i.e. they do not modify the same part of the state. The disadvantage is that in order to do so you need to understand the strategy loop, which can be a bit complex at first.\n",
        "2. **Subclassing**: In _Avalanche_, continual learning strategies inherit from the appropriate template, which provides generic training and evaluation loops. The most high level template is the `BaseTemplate`, from which all the _Avalanche_'s strategies inherit. Most template's methods can be safely overridden (with some caveats that we will see later).\n",
        "\n",
        "Keep in mind that if you already have a working continual learning strategy that does not use _Avalanche_, you can use most Avalanche components such as `benchmarks`, `evaluation`, and `models` without using _Avalanche_'s strategies!\n",

        "### Training and Evaluation Loops\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Basic _Training_ and _Evaluation_ loops which define a naive (finetuning) strategy.\n",
        "2. _Callback_ points, which are used to call the plugins at a specific moments during the loop's execution.\n",

        "Plugins provide a simple solution to define a new strategy by augmenting the behavior of another strategy (typically the `Naive` strategy). This approach reduces the overhead and code duplication, **improving code readability and prototyping speed**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Creating a plugin is straightforward. As with strategies, you must create a class that inherits from the corresponding plugin template (`BasePlugin`, `BaseSGDPlugin`, `SupervisedPlugin`) and implements the callbacks that you need. The exact callback to use depend on the aim of your plugin. You can use the loop shown above to understand what callbacks you need to use. For example, we show below a simple replay plugin that uses `after_training_exp` to update the buffer after each training experience, and the `before_training_exp` to customize the dataloader. Notice that `before_training_exp` is executed after `make_train_dataloader`, which means that the `Naive` strategy already updated the dataloader. If we used another callback, such as `before_train_dataset_adaptation`, our dataloader would have been overwritten by the `Naive` strategy. Plugin methods always receive the `strategy` as an argument, so they can access and modify the strategy's state."

For example, `train` calls `before_training` and `after_training` before and after the training loops, respectively. The easiest way to avoid mistakes is to start from the template's method that you want to override and modify it based on your own needs without removing the callbacks handling.\n",

For instance, the `Cumulative` strategy trains a model continually on the union of all the experiences encountered so far. To achieve this, the cumulative strategy overrides `adapt_train_dataset` and updates `self.adapted_dataset' by concatenating all the previous experiences with the current one."
